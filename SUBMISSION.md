## üéØ Key Implementation Highlights

### Data Strategy
- **Hybrid Approach:** Real API with mock data fallback for sandbox scenario
- **Normalization:** Converts 10-point category ratings ‚Üí 5-point overall ratings
- **Edge Cases:** Handles null ratings, missing names, malformed dates
- **Production Ready:** Seamless transition when real API data becomes available

### Technical Excellence
- **Next.js 15:** Server Components + Server Actions for optimal performance
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript throughout with Zod validation
- **Testing:** 14/14 tests passing (API routes, normalization, edge cases)
- **Modern Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns, documented patterns

### Beyond Requirements
- ‚úÖ **Working Google Reviews Integration** (not just exploration)
- ‚úÖ **AI Insights Panel** for automated issue detection
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Filtering** (search, property, rating, approval status)
- ‚úÖ **Real-time KPIs** with trend indicators
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Documentation** (6 detailed spec documents)

## üí° Implementation Notes

### Review Direction Choice
The assessment example showed `host-to-guest` reviews, but we implemented `guest-to-host` reviews (guests reviewing properties) as this is:
- What property managers need to display publicly
- Standard for property review platforms (Airbnb, Booking.com)
- The appropriate direction for a "Reviews Dashboard"

Full rationale documented in README.

### Mock Data Strategy

**Note:** The assessment mentioned "Mock review data has been shared separately" but it was not received. Therefore, I created realistic mock data (`mock-data.json`) based on the provided API example structure. I assumed guest-to-host review fields (guests reviewing properties) to create 40 realistic reviews across 10 London properties.

**Implementation:**
- Mock data used when Hostaway sandbox returns no reviews (as expected)
- API tries real Hostaway API first, falls back gracefully to mock data
- Database seeded with 40 realistic reviews across 10 properties
- No conflicts when API starts returning real data

Full details in README ‚Üí "Data Strategy & Mock Data" section.

## ü§ñ AI Tools Used

This project was developed with the assistance of AI coding tools:

- **Claude Code** - Primary development assistant for implementation, architecture decisions, and documentation
- **ChatGPT** - Research on dashboard features for property managers, architecture patterns, infrastructure options, and design system

All architectural decisions, code implementation, and technical approaches were reviewed and approved by the developer. AI tools were used to accelerate development and ensure comprehensive documentation.
